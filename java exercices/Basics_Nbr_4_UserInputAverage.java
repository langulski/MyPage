        //1. Using the constants above, ask the user to enter 3 numbers into 3 different int variables. 
        //   For example: int newIntOne = keyboard.nextInt();  
    
        //2. In one line of code, 
        //   add the 3 numbers together and divide by 3 and store the result in a variable named theAverage. 
        //   Hint: The average will not be an int.
        
        
        //3. Display output like the below to the console. Don't worry about the number of digits to the right of the decimal. 
        //   The average of 15, 7, and 22 is 14.666666666666666
