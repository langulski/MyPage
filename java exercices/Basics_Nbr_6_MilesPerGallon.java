        //1. Ask the user: "How many Miles did you drive?"
        
        //2. Get input from the user like this:    double yourOwnVariableNameSoYouShouldChangeThis = keyboard.nextDouble();
        
        //3. Ask the user "How many gallons of gas did you use?"
        
        //4. Get input from the user like this:    double yourOwnVariableNameSoYouShouldChangeThis = keyboard.nextDouble();
        
        //5. Calculate the miles per gallon using this formula:     Miles Driven / Gallons of Gas used
        
        //6. Display the miles per gallon the user got like this: Your car received 19.4 miles per gallon
